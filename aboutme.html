    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>What am I working toward in my personal and professional life and what experiences led me here? I am working towards graduating high school and getting my diploma at Naples High School. I have been turning assignments in, getting good grades, and putting all my effort into my academic career to set up a successful future for myself.
How am I working toward these goals? I turn in my assignments that are assigned the day of or the day after and I do not procrastinate on my work. I work hard in school so I can be successful after high school and throughout my lifetime. 
What values do I consider most necessary for my success? I think that work ethic is a big value for me because if you don't work hard for something you want do you really want it? I also pride myself on trust, because trust is the first thing that can be broken and the first to be gained and if you trust someone it takes you very far in life.
What short-term goals do I hope to accomplish in the near future? I hope to get my high school diploma first of all, second of all I hope to be able to join the military to serve. Other goals I have is to start a business someday, even if I'm not selling things I want to at least have one online.
What are the character traits and achievements I most want to be known for? I want to be known as a humble person, because being humble is the way to gain respect from peers and yourself and your ethics. Another trait I want to be known for is trustworthy, because I want to be able to handle responsibilities and to be tasked with assignments and I would want the person assigning it to trust I can achieve the goals and tasks.</p>
